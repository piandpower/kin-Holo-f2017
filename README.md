### Hololens Template

Video at https://youtu.be/KxvAm2qNJ0Q 

So here I propose a template to easily develop for the Hololens on UE4.

A very important note: This is based on an branch of Unreal currently and actively developed by a very dedicated Microsoft team.
For version 1.0, gesture are not enabled yet and spatial mapping is used with limitations.
Expect a rapid development while we'll follow the team and enable features after features.
I'll try to do my best to speed up the development, but hey the goal here is to put the community talents together to
finally have a well-working, fully-enabled Hololens template. This will be also very handy for Windows Mixed-Reality HMDs which are
coming to us in a near future.
However I keep a focus an Hololens since I personnaly think that spatial mapping and hand-gestures recognition is the future of VR/AR.
